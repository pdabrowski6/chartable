# The Chartable Ruby gem

The Chartable gem is a lightweight and database-level library to transform any Active Record query into analytics hash ready for use with any chart library.

**Supported database engines:** `MySQL` and `PostgreSQL`

## Installation
    gem install chartable

## Usage examples

The gem adds the `analytics` class method to all Rails models. Currently, five analytics periods are available: `yearly`, `weekly`, `monthly`, `quarterly` and `daily`. If it's not specified then it operates on the `created_at` column.

```ruby
User.analytics(:yearly) # => { 2017 => 5, 2018 => 30 }
User.analytics(:monthly) # => { "November 2018" => 1, "October 2018" => 1 }
User.analytics(:daily) # => {"October 09, 2018" => 1, "October 10, 2018" => 1}
User.analytics(:weekly) # => {"01/28/18 - 02/03/18" => 1, "02/11/18 - 02/17/18" => 1}
User.analytics(:quarterly) # => {"Q1 2018" => 1, "Q2 2018" => 1}
```

If you want to change the column used for sorting then specify the `:on` option:

```ruby
User.analytics(:yearly, on: 'updated_at')
```

If you want to narrow the results you can pass `from:` or/and `to:` options. You can pass any valid value of type `String`, `Date`, `DateTime` or `Time` - it will be transformed to the date format:

```ruby
User.analytics(:yearly, from: Date.yesterday, to: Date.today)
```

You can also call `analytics` on any query:

```ruby
User.where(first_name: 'John').where.not(last_name: 'Doe').analytics(:daily)
```

### Sorting

With the `0.0.0.3` version is possible to sort results:

```ruby
User.analytics(:yearly, order: 'desc') # or order: 'asc'
```
